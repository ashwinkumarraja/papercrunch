The application is targeted for the age group 11 and above and teaches them the basics of C language.
The user can use the app in the offline mode and learn all the concepts and attempt the
questions where all the data will be safely stored in the SQLite database and the shared preferences file. The user can also save all the progress by having an authenticated account saved on the server
which will have all the progress content and level status. By this the user can log in and log out from any
device and use the same account and continue from where he/she left.
Most of the vitals include a neat UI and the accessibility of all the content is made easy by the
hamburger menu and the dashboard menu where all the levels are shown to make the user have a good
experience and less confusing. 
The user can always think it as a game and play in a competitive mode or learn at his own pace and
receive the incentives like badges to keep him intrigued in the learning process. 
If the user ever wanted to start everything afresh , they could always do so by resetting all the
progress and start the learning all over again. 
More and more languages could be added inside the app
other than C programming if one thinks of updating the app. There will be more learning and also easy
as people will be well familiar with the UI and basics that it will be easy for them to pick up new
concepts.
Hence the application is a great platform for beginners and enthusiastic learners.
